  Alterations:
   * Make the counter public, so that we can use it in our custom mint function
   * Removed ERC721Burnable parent contract, but added our own custom burn function.
   * Removed original "mint" function, because we have a custom one.
   * Removed default initialization functions, because they set _msgSender() as the owner, which
     we do not want, because we use a deployer account, which is separate from the protocol owner.

 * This contract uses {AccessControlEnumerable} to lock permissioned functions using the

 * The account that deploys the contract will be granted the minter and pauser
